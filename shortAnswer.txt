1 What is the difference between an API and a server?

An API (Application Program Interface) is software from the internet to provide a service.
It allows for programmers to develop a program from that software,
with various information depending on the blocks of information that's used because API's are fun.
A server is a computer that responds to requests from clients (basically providing requested information)
because they are simple and boring.


2 What does a DNS server do when you type "www.google.com" into an address bar?

It uses technological witchcraft to turn the name into an IP address since
names are easier to recall then long numerical values separated by periods.


3 What are some differences between a single page application and a multipage application?
List one example of each.

The difference between a SPA and MPA is the structure of the information.

Single page apps load everything one time and heavily manipulate's it's DOM depending on
the user's request of information(rarely refreshing the page SAVING MONEY ON RESOURCES!).

Multi page apps request for new HTML, CSS, JS, JPG's and various other information
depending on the user's request of information (big resource players consuming
resources in the digital world because they BALLING).


4 Why do we use RESTful routes?

Using a verb in the URL makes it more action packed and exciting. The action
packed premise provides for shorter URL's easier for creating, reading,
updating and destroying information. CRUD!!


5 What is an API key and why are they used?

An API key is a unique key(password) provided by that API god(provider, company, random person, myself?).
They key is tracked to see where requests are coming from and how the API is being used. Depending on how
much you donate to that API god's cause(pricing plan), you are allowed various access rights.
